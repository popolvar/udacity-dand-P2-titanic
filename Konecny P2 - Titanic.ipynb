    "The sinking of Titanic is probably the most notorious peace time naval disaster in history. As such it is not only source of many popular legends, but also primary source of exposition of naval code of conduct in such tragic cases. For instance the the popular belief, that the captain should be the last person leaving the ship likely originates from dramatic portrayal of the Titanic disaster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another instance of maritime chivarly dictates, that 'woman and children (are) first' to board the rescue boats. However the 1997 Titanic movie tells a different story. Acording to the movie, the class and status of passangers took precedence over chivalry, and passangers for lower class were simply let drown regardless of their sex and age.\n",
    "\n",
    "My goal is to investigate whether the data supports either the chivalry or class based interpretation of the story.\n",

Using the [Passanger List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passengers_of_the_RMS_Titanic#Passenger_list) from Wikipedia and assuming that passange of age 12 and below are considered children (more on that in Data Wrangling section) I establish that there were 53 girls on Titanic.
