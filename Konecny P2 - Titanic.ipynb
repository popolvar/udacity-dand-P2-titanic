    "The sinking of Titanic is probably the most notorious peace time naval disaster in history. As such it is also the show case of the naval code of conduct in such tragic cases. For instance the popular notion, that the captain should leave the ship last likely originates from dramatic portrayals of the Titanic disaster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another instance of maritime chivalry dictates, that 'woman and children (are) first' to board the rescue boats. However the 1997 Titanic movie tells a different story. According to the movie, the class and status of passengers took precedence over chivalry, and passengers from lower classes were simply let drown, regardless of their sex and age.\n",

    "## Conclusion \n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the described analysis of the Kaggle dataset, I can now answer the stated questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "** Question 1. Had woman a children a higher chance to survive the Titanic  disaster regardless of their class status? **\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes. The survival rate was much higher for woman and children then for man in the same class. Children from Class has the lowest survival among woman an children 41.67%. But it was still slightly then highest survival rate for men (in the Class I) 37.76%.\n",
    "\n",
    "** Question 2. Had first class passengers a higher chance to survive then woman and children from lower classes?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, kind of. It is true for woman and children. The survival rate was the worst for the III Class among woman and children.\n",
    "\n",
    "As for men, the absolutely worst survival rate was for man in Class II - only 6.67%, followed by man in Class III - 12.72%. The highest survival rate for man was in Class I - 37.76%. This was slightly less then the 41.76% survival rate for Class III children, which is the lowest one among woman and children.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 3: Is the Kaggle data is a representative sample of the (population of) passengers of the Titanic (as described in Wikipedia)?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The trends in survival observed in the Kaggle dataset also occur in the Wikipedia dataset. The trends in Kaggle dataset even appear to be considerably stronger.\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be noted that I did not conduct a rigorous statical test. Since the number of classes is small, the distribution is binary and the trends are clear, my investigation seemed sufficient. \n",
    "\n",
    "I would expect that a rigourous statistical test would confirm my finding."
